v2.0.0.1
 - Added the ability to create Dynamic Javascript files.
    Javascript::importScript('simple', array("foo" => "bar"), false);
    This prints "<script src="<ROUTE>"></script>" to load the script

    All Dynamic scripts go to /src/resources/javascript and should have the extension ".js.php"

    Example Script
    ```js
    <?PHP
        use DynamicalWeb\HTML;
    ?>

    function dyn_test()
    {
        alert("<?PHP HTML::print("Hello World"); ?>")
    }
    ```
 - Bug fix when getting routes, printing can escape special characters for URL(s), which should not be the case.
 - Added delayed_redirect() to Actions
